# Raw Idea

## Feature Description

User Authentication with Supabase - Implement authentication supporting multiple providers:
- Apple OAuth
- Google OAuth
- SMS (passwordless login via OTP)
- Email (passwordless login via magic link/OTP)

## Context

This is item #8 from the product roadmap: "Implement email/password and OAuth sign-up/sign-in using Supabase Auth, including session management and protected routes for both web and mobile."

Note: The user wants passwordless flows for SMS and Email rather than traditional email/password.
