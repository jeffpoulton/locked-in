# Strava Integration Prototype - Raw Idea

Build initial Strava OAuth flow and activity verification as the first third-party verifier. Prove the concept: user connects Strava, selects activity type (run, ride, etc.), and daily check-ins auto-verify against logged activities. Keep it simple—this informs the verifier abstraction we'll refactor into later.
