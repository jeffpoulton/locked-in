# Raw Idea

**Feature:** Variable Reward Allocation Algorithm & Test Harness

**Source:** Product Roadmap - Phase 1, Item #1

**Description:**

Implement the core VIDC algorithm that randomly distributes the deposited amount across 20-85% of contract days with varying reward amounts (2-80% of principal per day). Build an admin-facing test harness UI to visualize generated reward distributions across sample contracts and simulate user scenarios (completing/missing days) to observe reward/forfeiture outcomes.

**Effort Estimate:** L (2 weeks)

**Phase:** MVP - Core Contract Mechanism

**Priority:** First feature in roadmap - foundational to the entire product
