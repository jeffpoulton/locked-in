# Product Mission

## Pitch

**Locked In** is an AI-driven accountability coaching app that helps motivated individuals build lasting habits by leveraging behavioral psychology through a Variable Interval Deposit Contract mechanism. Users deposit their own money and earn it back by completing daily actions - but they never know which days have rewards or how much each reward is worth, creating powerful loss-avoidance motivation that drives consistent action.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Health & Fitness Seekers:** People committed to building exercise routines, improving diet, or establishing better sleep habits
- **Professionals & Entrepreneurs:** Individuals building productivity habits, shipping consistently, or maintaining focus on high-value work

### User Personas

**Sarah** (32)
- **Role:** Marketing manager at a tech startup

- **Pain Points:** Has tried fitness apps, gym memberships, and workout buddies - always falls off after 2-3 weeks. Knows what to do but struggles with consistency.
- **Goals:** Complete 30 days of morning workouts to make it a non-negotiable habit

**Marcus** (28)
- **Role:** Solo founder building a SaaS product
- **Context:** Needs to ship code daily but gets distracted by Twitter, email, and "research"
- **Pain Points:** The "escrow to a friend" concept resonates with him - he's even tried it manually but friends are unreliable enforcers
- **Goals:** 21-day streak of shipping at least one meaningful feature or improvement daily

**Elena** (45)
- **Role:** Executive at a consulting firm
- **Context:** Wants to meditate daily to manage stress but can't make it stick

### Target Demographics

- **Age:** 18-50 years old

## The Problem

### Habit Apps Don't Create Real Stakes

Traditional habit tracking apps rely on streaks, badges, and positive reinforcement - but these "rewards" have no real value. Users can easily dismiss notifications, break streaks, and start over without consequence. The cost of failure is zero, so failure is easy.

**The accountability gap:** People know that having real consequences works (that's why "betting a friend $100" feels motivating), but:
- Friends are unreliable enforcers
- Social pressure feels uncomfortable
- Manual accountability systems are cumbersome

**Our Solution:** Locked In creates genuine financial stakes through an automated, psychologically-optimized system. You're not earning rewards - you're avoiding losses. And the unpredictable timing and amounts trigger the same variable reinforcement that makes slot machines compelling, but channeled toward positive behavior.

### Why People Fail at Habits

1. **No immediate consequence for skipping** - The cost of missing one day feels negligible
2. **Predictable systems become ignorable** - Daily reminders at 8am become background noise
3. **Positive framing is weak** - "Earn a badge!" doesn't compete with Netflix
4. **Social accountability is awkward** - Nobody wants to text their friend "I didn't work out today"

**Our Solution:** Variable Interval Deposit Contracts address all four:
1. Real money is at stake every single day
2. Unpredictable rewards create anticipation and engagement
3. Loss avoidance is psychologically stronger than gain seeking
4. The system is automated - no awkward social dynamics

## Differentiators

### Variable Interval Deposit Contracts (VIDC)

Unlike traditional habit apps that reward completion with points or streaks, Locked In uses a deposit-and-recovery system with variable timing. This leverages three powerful psychological principles:

1. **Loss Aversion:** People feel losses roughly 2x more intensely than equivalent gains. Recovering your own money feels urgent in a way that "earning points" never will.

2. **Variable Reinforcement:** By randomizing which days have rewards (20-85% of days) and how much each reward is worth (2-80% of principal), we create the same engagement pattern that makes games compelling - but directed at positive habits.

3. **Avoidance Conditioning:** Users learn to associate inaction with loss, building automatic behavior over time.

**Result:** Users don't just track habits - they feel genuine motivation to complete them every single day.

### AI-Powered Personal Coaching

Unlike generic reminder apps, Locked In provides personalized AI coaching that:
- Understands your specific goals and obstacles
- Adapts messaging based on your progress patterns
- Provides motivation when you're struggling and celebration when you succeed
- Offers actionable guidance, not just notifications

### Flexible Verification

Unlike apps that only support self-reporting (easy to cheat) or require specific integrations (limiting), Locked In offers multiple verification methods:
- Self-report with friction (prevents mindless check-offs)
- Photo proof for visual habits
- Integration with fitness trackers, coding platforms, meditation apps
- AI-assisted verification for subjective habits

## Success Metrics

### User Success
- **Completion Rate:** Percentage of contracted days where users complete their habit
- **Contract Completion:** Percentage of users who finish their full cycle
- **Habit Persistence:** Percentage of users who continue the habit after the contract ends
- **Recovery Rate:** Average percentage of deposit recovered by users

### Business Success
- **User Retention:** 30/60/90 day retention rates
- **Contract Renewals:** Users starting new contracts after completing one
- **Revenue:** Forfeited deposits (ethical note: we succeed when users succeed, so this is a tension to manage)

## Ethical Considerations

### We Win When Users Win

Our primary goal is habit formation, not deposit forfeiture. The system is designed so that engaged users recover most or all of their money. Forfeitures happen, but they're a consequence of the mechanism working - not our business model.

### Responsible Deposit Limits

- Minimum deposit: $10 (meaningful but not harmful)
- Maximum deposit: $1000 (prevents gambling-like behavior)
- Clear warnings about only depositing what you can afford to lose
- No ability to "double down" or increase stakes mid-contract

### Transparent Mechanics

Users understand exactly how the system works before depositing:
- Clear explanation of variable reward distribution
- Historical data on average recovery rates
- No hidden fees or surprise deductions
