# Product Mission

## Pitch

**Locked In** is the only accountability coach that refunds you based on your success. Unlike coaches or apps that charge monthly fees regardless of results, Locked In flips the model: deposit your own money upfront, complete your daily habit, and earn it all back. Miss a day that had a reward? That money is forfeited - creating real stakes that drive real action.

Here's the twist: you never know which days have rewards or how much they're worth. It's the same psychology that makes games hard to put down - that "maybe today's the day" feeling - except it's pushing you toward the gym instead of pulling you toward your phone.

## The Problem

### Habit Apps Don't Create Real Stakes

Traditional habit tracking apps rely on streaks, badges, and positive reinforcement - but these "rewards" have no real value. Users can easily dismiss notifications, break streaks, and start over without consequence. The cost of failure is zero, so failure is easy.

**The accountability gap:** People know that having real consequences works (that's why "betting a friend $100" feels motivating), but:
- Friends are unreliable enforcers
- Social pressure feels uncomfortable
- Manual accountability systems are cumbersome

**Our Solution:** Locked In creates genuine financial stakes through an automated, psychologically-optimized system. You're not earning rewards - you're avoiding losses. And the unpredictable timing and amounts trigger the same variable reinforcement that makes slot machines compelling, but channeled toward positive behavior.

### Why People Fail at Habits

1. **No immediate consequence for skipping** - The cost of missing one day feels negligible
2. **Predictable systems become ignorable** - Daily reminders at 8am become background noise
3. **Positive framing is weak** - "Earn a badge!" doesn't compete with Netflix
4. **Social accountability is awkward** - Nobody wants to text their friend "I didn't work out today"

**Our Solution:** Variable Interval Deposit Contracts address all four:
1. Real money is at stake every single day
2. Unpredictable rewards create anticipation and engagement
3. Loss avoidance is psychologically stronger than gain seeking
4. The system is automated - no awkward social dynamics

## Differentiators

### Variable Interval Deposit Contracts (VIDC)

Unlike traditional habit apps that reward completion with points or streaks, Locked In uses a deposit-and-recovery system with variable timing. This leverages three powerful psychological principles:

1. **Loss Aversion:** People feel losses roughly 2x more intensely than equivalent gains. Recovering your own money feels urgent in a way that "earning points" never will.

2. **Variable Reinforcement:** By randomizing which days have rewards (20-85% of days) and how much each reward is worth (2-80% of principal), we create the same engagement pattern that makes games compelling - but directed at positive habits.

3. **Avoidance Conditioning:** Users learn to associate inaction with loss, building automatic behavior over time.

**Result:** Users don't just track habits - they feel genuine motivation to complete them every single day.

- Understands your specific goals and obstacles

- Self-report with friction (prevents mindless check-offs)

- AI-assisted verification for subjective habits

## Success Metrics

### User Success
- **Completion Rate:** Percentage of contracted days where users complete their habit
- **Contract Completion:** Percentage of users who finish their full cycle
- **Habit Persistence:** Percentage of users who continue the habit after the contract ends
- **Recovery Rate:** Average percentage of deposit recovered by users

### Business Success
- **User Retention:** 30/60/90 day retention rates
- **Contract Renewals:** Users starting new contracts after completing one
- **Revenue:** Forfeited deposits (ethical note: we succeed when users succeed, so this is a tension to manage)

## Ethical Considerations

### We Win When Users Win

Our primary goal is habit formation, not deposit forfeiture. The system is designed so that engaged users recover most or all of their money. Forfeitures happen, but they're a consequence of the mechanism working - not our business model.

### Where Forfeited Money Goes

When a user misses a day that contained a reward, that amount becomes non-refundable and goes to Locked In. This is our primary revenue model. We don't donate it to charity (which would dilute the personal stakes) and we don't refund it (which would undermine the entire mechanism). The forfeiture is real - that's what makes the motivation real.

This aligns incentives honestly: we make money when users fail to follow through on their own commitments. We're transparent about this, and we mitigate the tension by designing for user success - variable reward schedules, AI coaching, multiple verification methods - all aimed at maximizing completion rates. A user who recovers 100% of their deposit is a user who built a habit, and that's the outcome we're optimizing for.

### Early Exit Policy

Life happens. If a user needs to exit a contract before completion, we offer a fair but clear-eyed exit:

- **First 48 hours:** Full refund, no questions asked. Sometimes people realize immediately that they overcommitted or the timing is wrong.
- **After 48 hours:** Refund of 50% of remaining unrevealed rewards. The other 50% is forfeited as an "exit fee."

The 50% structure accomplishes several things:
1. **Not predatory:** Users get meaningful money back, not held hostage
2. **Not a free pass:** There's a real cost to backing out that reinforces the commitment they made
3. **Honest framing:** We're not pretending this is a subscription they can cancel - they made a bet on themselves and are choosing not to see it through
4. **Encourages completion:** The math almost always favors finishing the contract if you're even moderately successful

Users who exit receive a message acknowledging their decision without judgment: "You committed money to becoming a better version of yourself. That took courage. This time didn't work out, but the commitment itself matters. We hope to see you back when the timing is right."

### Responsible Deposit Limits

- Minimum deposit: $10 (meaningful but not harmful)
- Maximum deposit: $1000 (prevents gambling-like behavior)
- Clear warnings about only depositing what you can afford to lose
- No ability to "double down" or increase stakes mid-contract

### Transparent Mechanics

Users understand exactly how the system works before depositing:
- Clear explanation of variable reward distribution
- Historical data on average recovery rates
- No hidden fees or surprise deductions
- Clear explanation of early exit terms before commitment
